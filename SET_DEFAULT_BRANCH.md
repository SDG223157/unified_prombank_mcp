## 🔍 **Verification Steps**

After changing on GitHub, verify the change:

### **1. Check GitHub Repository**
- Visit: https://github.com/SDG223157/unified_prombank_mcp
- The main branch should be shown by default
- Branch dropdown should show "main" as default

### **2. Test New Clone**
```bash
# Test in a different directory
git clone https://github.com/SDG223157/unified_prombank_mcp test-clone
cd test-clone
git branch  # Should show "main" as current branch
```

### **3. Check Remote HEAD**
```bash
git ls-remote --symref origin HEAD
# Should show: ref: refs/heads/main	HEAD
```

## 📋 **Current Status**

✅ **Local Repository:**
- Default branch: main
- Remote HEAD: origin/main
- Current branch: main

⏳ **GitHub Repository:**
- Needs manual update via GitHub web interface
- Will show main as default after update

---

## 🎯 **Why This Change?**

**Benefits of main as default:**
- ✅ **Industry standard** - main is the modern default branch name
- ✅ **Feature complete** - main now has all latest features from unified-clean
- ✅ **Production ready** - includes all security fixes and enhancements
- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation** - all guides and tools included
- ✅ **8 MCP tools** - complete functionality

**Previous state:**
- unified-clean was default (development branch)
- main was outdated (legacy version)

**Current state:**
- Both branches synchronized
- main has all latest features
- Ready for production use

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Update GitHub default branch** (via web interface)
2. **Consider branch strategy:**
   - Keep `main` for stable releases
   - Use `unified-clean` or create `develop` for ongoing development
   - Create feature branches for new features

3. **Update documentation** if needed
4. **Notify team members** about the default branch change

---

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- **Existing clones** will still use their original default branch
- **New clones** will automatically use main after GitHub update
- **CI/CD pipelines** may need updating if they reference the old default
- **Protected branch rules** may need to be updated

---

**Ready to complete the default branch change on GitHub!** 🎉
