# API Token Security Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the security improvements made to ensure that API tokens are properly isolated by user and cannot be accessed by unauthorized users.

## Issue Identified

The user reported being able to see API tokens created by other users, which is a serious security vulnerability that could lead to unauthorized access to other users' accounts and data.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Token Filtering

**Python Backend (`unified-python/main.py`):**
- Added explicit user ID filtering in all token queries
- Added security logging for audit trails
- Added additional verification checks to ensure returned tokens belong to the authenticated user

**Node.js Backend (`backend/src/routes/tokens.js`):**
- Enhanced token queries with proper user ID filtering
- Added comprehensive logging for security monitoring
- Added verification loops to ensure no cross-user token exposure

### 2. Improved Logging and Monitoring

All token operations now include:
- User identification logging (user ID and email)
- Operation type logging (create, read, update, delete)
- Security alert logging for any suspicious activity
- Success/failure logging for audit trails

### 3. Additional Security Checks

**Double Verification:**
- Database queries filter by `user_id`
- Additional runtime checks verify token ownership
- Cross-user access attempts are logged as security alerts

**Explicit Access Control:**
- All token endpoints require authentication
- Token operations explicitly check ownership
- Unauthorized access attempts return 403/404 errors

### 4. Debug and Monitoring Endpoints

Added debug endpoints to help verify token isolation:
- `/api/tokens/debug/ownership` - Shows token ownership information
- Includes user token count vs. total system tokens
- Can be removed in production environments

## Code Changes Summary

### Python Backend Changes

1. **Enhanced `get_tokens()` endpoint:**
   - Added user identification logging
   - Added security verification loop
   - Enhanced response with debugging information

2. **Enhanced `update_token()` endpoint:**
   - Added ownership verification
   - Added security alert logging
   - Enhanced error handling

3. **Enhanced `delete_token()` endpoint:**
   - Added ownership verification
   - Added operation logging
   - Enhanced security checks

4. **Enhanced `get_mcp_config()` endpoint:**
   - Added ownership verification
   - Added access logging
   - Enhanced security measures

### Node.js Backend Changes

1. **Enhanced token listing endpoint:**
   - Added comprehensive logging
   - Added security verification loop
   - Enhanced response format

2. **Enhanced token update endpoint:**
   - Added ownership verification
   - Added security alert logging
   - Enhanced access control

3. **Enhanced token deletion endpoint:**
   - Added ownership verification
   - Added operation logging
   - Enhanced security measures

## Testing

### Automated Security Test

A comprehensive test script (`test_token_security.py`) has been created to verify:

1. **Token Isolation:** Users can only see their own tokens
2. **Cross-User Access Prevention:** Users cannot access other users' tokens
3. **Ownership Verification:** All token operations respect ownership
4. **Security Logging:** All operations are properly logged

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Create multiple test users**
2. **Create tokens for each user**
3. **Verify token isolation:**
   - Each user should only see their own tokens
   - Token counts should match expectations
4. **Test cross-user access:**
   - Attempts to access other users' tokens should fail
   - Security alerts should be logged

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users can only access their own tokens
2. **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of security checks
3. **Audit Logging:** All operations are logged for security monitoring
4. **Fail Secure:** Unauthorized access attempts are denied and logged
5. **Input Validation:** All token operations validate ownership

## Recommendations

### For Production

1. **Remove Debug Endpoints:** Remove `/debug/ownership` endpoints in production
2. **Monitor Logs:** Set up alerts for security violation logs
3. **Regular Audits:** Periodically verify token isolation is working
4. **Rate Limiting:** Consider adding rate limits to token operations

### For Development

1. **Run Security Tests:** Use the provided test script regularly
2. **Review Logs:** Check for any security alerts during development
3. **Test Edge Cases:** Verify security works with various user scenarios

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Run the security test suite
python test_token_security.py

# Check token ownership (adjust URL and auth as needed)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:8000/api/tokens/debug/ownership

# Verify token isolation
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:8000/api/tokens
```

## Conclusion

The implemented security improvements ensure that:

1. ✅ Users can only see and manage their own API tokens
2. ✅ Cross-user token access is prevented and logged
3. ✅ All token operations are properly authenticated and authorized
4. ✅ Security violations are detected and logged
5. ✅ The system follows security best practices

The API token system is now properly secured and isolated by user, preventing the security vulnerability that was originally reported.
